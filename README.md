Summer 2018/University of Washington Seattle
There are four labs in total which will be contained in four separate folders. Each of them contain one spec, one lab report, and the matlab code of each exercise. The code in the report are my initial code, and the code in matlab file are the revised code after grading. This is a solo lab, so the logic among all of these labs should be the same. Hope you can learn something from my work, and enjoy your lab!
